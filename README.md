## Description
Interplanetary Age calculator. Enter your age to find out how many "years" old you are on various planets. As a bonus, enter in a number of years to see how far the planets travel over that span of time... ish. Take the math with a grain of salt. Assigned as the Week 5 independent code review for Epicodus, demonstrating best testing practices with Jest/Babel, using webpack to make a more machine-readable website.

## Known Bugs

Background image is a little dodgy. Remind self to look up ways to keep it static, or find better column solution.

The math is almost certainly wrong for distance travelled. Don't quote it. I'm no physicist. Or mathematician. Or rocket scientist.
